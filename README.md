## About project
We are a team from SUTD developing Airplain as part of our Design Thinking Project module. Airplain is a linear regression model written in python to predict the rates of air pollution in a city, given certain parameters.

## Goals
To assist urban city planners with planning sustainable cities, by providing them with an accurate estimate of how much air pollution their planned city will make.
