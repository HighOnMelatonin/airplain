# Welcome to **Airplain**

We are a team from SUTD developing Airplain as part of our Design Thinking Project module.  
Airplain is a linear regression model written in python to predict the rates of air pollution in a city.  
Parameters:
* Population density (people/km2)
* Land use for main roads (in hectares)
* Land use for parks and public gardens (hectares)
* Normalized proximity to facilities from 0 to 10
* Normalized proximity to facilities from 10 to 20
* Normalized proximity to facilities from 20 to 50   
    * The sum of these 3 normalized parameters must be 1
