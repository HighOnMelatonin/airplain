# Welcome to **carGo**

We are a team from SUTD developing carGo as part of our Design Thinking Project module.  
carGo is a linear regression model written in Python to predict urban private car reliance.  
## Parameters:
* Population Density (people/kmÂ²)
* Normalized Proximity to Facilities 
    * From 0 to 10
    * From 10 to 20
    * From 20 to 50   
    * The sum of these 3 normalized parameters must be 1
* Average Distance Travelled Per Trip for Public Transport (in kilometres)
    * Includes Trains, Trams, Metros, Buses
